              </h5>
              <p className="Content text-secondary lh-lg ">
                When you opt for a construction home, you can customize it
                according to your preferences. You can have a say in everything
                from the layout to the finishes, making it your dream home.

              </h5>
              <p className="Content text-secondary lh-lg ">
                These built homes are equipped with energy-efficient
                technologies. This not only helps you save on utility bills but
                also reduces your carbon footprint contributing to the
                environment.

              <p className="Content text-secondary lh-lg ">
                Builders usually provide warranties that cover components of the
                home for a period. Moreover, new homes generally require
                maintenance compared to older properties allowing you to enjoy
                worry-free living.
              </p>

              <p className="Content text-secondary lh-lg ">
                Many new construction neighborhoods offer an array of amenities,
                like parks, pools, and gyms. These amenities foster a sense of
                community where residents can come together and enjoy shared
                spaces.
